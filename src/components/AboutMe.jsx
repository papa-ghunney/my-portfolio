          <p>
            Iâ€™m a designer and developer born and bred in the city of Accra. I
            enjoy reading, watching movies and listening to calm soothing music.
            I love learning and trying new ideas whenever I can.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I'm currently job searching. I spend most of my days
            practicing and doing what I love to do in the day, code!. I believe
            with constant practice comes perfection.
