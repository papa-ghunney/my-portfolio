        paragraphOne: `An Ecommerce site is a website where users can conduct business transactions without being physically present at the shop.
            In this project I designed a simple ecommerce site that makes use of both frontend and backend technology. Here, at the frontend I used redux state management to manage the state of the 
            website. It included  adding items into the cart. Being able to login to your own dashboard to make these transactions.`,
        paragraphTwo: `It also included an Admin dashboard where the admin is able to see the number of transactions conducted and he being able to add edit or delete products in the store. With the backend, we were able to
        load products from the backend by building REST APIs in conjuction with Axios which helped get products unto the side of the front end. This project helped broaden my understanding of using Express JS, Async await as products will be loaded from the database 
        and broadened my understanding of the MongoDB model being used to create models for the web application`,
